# Keep The Rain!

A simple server side mod that prevents rain timer from resetting after sleep and gives a chance for rain to continue after players woke up.

Made this mod for myself because I love rain and hate the vanilla feature that resets the rain timer, so if you sleep every night, you won't have any rain at all in your world.
